At this early stage of development there's only one usable executable -
upperbody1.py, a slightly misnamed script that runs a set of kettle bell
exercises mainly focussing on the arms and core.

Coming soon will be a far more extensible and configurable version that
will come with more than one set of exercises, and be more easily configured
to run any choice of exercises you'd like to do.
